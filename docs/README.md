# Barcode Scanner
The barcode scanner has a thing called "Automatic Mode." In automatic mode, you don't need to hold down the trigger. It also uses ambient light to scan the barcodes, so when you leave it on, the lasers power down until it senses something under the scanner.

Automatic mode works when you first plug it in. If you pull the trigger, you have to un-plug and re-plug in the scanner.
